# How to restore your server?

**NOTICE :** Before actually restoring you might want to check out the `What's in the encrypted backup file?` section

#

First, save the `[SERVER_ID].pub` file and the desired encrypted json backup.

Then, on your new server, invite Backup Bot and follow the given orders.

It will ask you to scan a QR code, but it's just to set up the server correctly.
(Please note, that none of your data is kept).

All the data is encrypted because **ANYONE IS A THREAT, YOU INCLUDED** *cough cough*, I mean for the integrity of the backup in itself.

Eventually, your server will have done recovering.

# What if I need to change something in the encrypted backup file?
Just send a DM out to the owner including the change and the reason for the change. (Don't forget to copy paste, username contains Unicode)

# How...

## ...is it free?
You probably noticed, but we got none of the paid rank crap. This is because no file hosting solution is needed.

## ...does it work?
All the server, channels and roles data is stored on the encrypted JSON file. We only have to decrypt the file and apply the orders.

To keep the rank positions, we will ask you to scan a QR code for a short intervention with your discord account.
